title: CodeWeekEU 2015 Storytelling and Video Contest
---

<p>Europe Code Week ambassadors encourage all event organizers to tell their CodeWeek stories by making short videos and sharing them on YouTube.</p>

<p>The CodeWeekEU-2015 Video Contest provides an additional motivation to share and promote the videos in order to keep raising awareness of the importance of computational thinking beyond Code Week.</p>

<p>You can take participate with three kinds of videos: 
<ul>
    <li>videos made during CodeWeek events</li>
    <li>videos reporting the effects of the <a href="http://codeweek.eu/odetocode/">"Ode to code" tune</a></li>
    <li>videos showing the results of a remix of the <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/codeweekeu/">CodeWeekEU tutorial</a> on Scratch</li>. 
</ul>
The "Ode to code" is an open source music made to celebrate Europe Code Week 2015. It can be freely added as a sound track to your videos, or remixed to make your own sound track. All the resources you need for your project are available on <a href="http://codeweek.it/ode-to-code/">http://codeweek.it/ode-to-code/</a></p>
